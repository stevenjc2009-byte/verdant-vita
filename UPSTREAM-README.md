# 3DS-CLI [![Release](https://github.com/cmdada/3DS-CLI/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cmdada/3DS-CLI/actions/workflows/release.yml) [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/cmdada/3ds-cli/total.svg)](https://github.com/cmdada/3DS-CLI/releases) <a href="https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/3ds-cli"><img src="https://gitlab.com/gitbrew/GitHub3DS/-/raw/main/files/images/Universal_Updater.svg" alt="UU" height="20"></a>


Run real RISC-V Linux on various consoles: Nintendo's 3DS, Wii U, Switch, Wii
and GameCube, and Sony's PSP, PS Vita and PS3.

3DS-CLI boots a stock RV32 Linux 6.6 kernel with a glibc userspace off your SD
card, using [mini-rv32ima-mmu](https://github.com/cmdada/mini-rv32ima-mmu), mini-rv32ima with a full Sv32 MMU, S-mode and a built-in SBI,
running as ordinary homebrew.

- A terminal (ANSI/xterm, 24-bit colour, zoom, panning) and a touch keyboard,
  on the two screens where the console has two, split top and bottom where it
  has one.
- Writes go straight to `rootfs.ext2` on the SD card. No save step, and nothing
  is lost if the battery dies.
- Networking over the console's WiFi. `wget`, `ssh` and `ntpd` all work.
- The guest gets real hardware: SD card, NAND, battery, sensors, sliders,
  cameras, mic, speakers.
- Comes with bash, vim, nano, htop, tree, wget, dropbear, BusyBox.
- Runs on Old 3DS and New 3DS, and on the Wii U, Switch, Wii, GameCube, PSP,
  Vita and PS3. One `Image` boots on all of them, because the guest is
  identical and only the host binary differs.

## Install

**Universal Updater** (3DS): find 3DS-CLI in
[the app](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/3ds-cli) and it does the rest.

**Manual**, from the latest release zip. Copy `Image` to the root of the SD
card, then your console's binary. The rootfs is bundled inside `Image`, so
that's everything. First boot is slower because it unpacks `rootfs.ext2` to
the card, which is the writable disk from then on. Log in as `root` with a
blank password.

On the 3DS, Wii U, Switch, PSP and Vita you can copy just the binary and skip
`Image`: launched with none on the card, the app offers to download the latest
release's over WiFi. The Wii, GameCube and PS3 have no TLS stack to do that
with.

| Console | Binary | Goes to |
|---|---|---|
| 3DS | `3ds/3ds-cli.3dsx` | `sdmc:/3ds/3ds-cli/` |
| Wii U | `wiiu/3ds-cli.wuhb` | `sd:/wiiu/apps/` |
| Switch | `switch/3ds-cli.nro` | `sdmc:/switch/` |
| Wii | `wii/3ds-cli.dol` | `sd:/apps/3ds-cli/boot.dol` |
| GameCube | `gamecube/3ds-cli.dol` | an SD Gecko or SD2SP2 |
| PSP | `psp/EBOOT.PBP` | `ms0:/PSP/GAME/3ds-cli/` |
| PS Vita | `vita/3ds-cli.vpk` | install with VitaShell, then `Image` to `ux0:/` |
| PS3 | `ps3/3ds-cli.pkg` | install from the XMB, then `Image` to `/dev_hdd0/3ds-cli/` |

The GameCube needs an SD Gecko or SD2SP2: the rootfs is ~200MB and a memory
card cannot hold it. It also has the least RAM of them all, so it is the
tightest fit.

The PS3 is the one console here with no removable card: its files live on the
internal drive under `/dev_hdd0/3ds-cli/`, which is easiest to fill over FTP.
It needs a display that can do 720p, because that is the only mode the terminal
is laid out for. There is a `ps3/3ds-cli.self` in the release too, for loaders
that want one instead of the `.pkg`.

### What each console gives the guest

| Switch | 512MB | one, split | touchscreen | yes |
| Wii | 48MB | one, split | Wiimote IR | yes |
| GameCube | 20MB | one, split | none, D-pad focus | no |
| PSP | 20-48MB | one, split | none, D-pad focus | yes |
| PS Vita | 192MB | one, split | touchscreen | yes |
| PS3 | 128MB | one, split | none, D-pad focus | yes |

## Hardware passthrough

The console shows up under `/mnt/3ds`:

```
sd     the real SD card, read-write
nand   CTR NAND, read-only
twl    TWL NAND, read-only
hw     sensors, power, camera, mic, speakers
```

`sd` is the same card the Homebrew Launcher reads, so it's the easiest way to
get files in and out. `nand` and `twl` need Luma3DS extended homebrew
permissions. Without those they just don't show up.

`hw` is just files:

```sh
cat /mnt/3ds/hw/battery                          # 87
cat /mnt/3ds/hw/accel                            # 12 -4 251   (x y z)
cat /mnt/3ds/hw/info                             # summary of everything
echo "info 255 0 0" > /mnt/3ds/hw/leds           # notification LED (R G B)
cat /mnt/3ds/hw/camera_outer.rgb565 > shot.raw   # one 400x240 RGB565 frame
dd if=/mnt/3ds/hw/mic.pcm of=rec.pcm count=100   # signed 16-bit mono, 16kHz
cat music.pcm > /mnt/3ds/hw/audio.pcm            # signed 16-bit stereo, 32730Hz
```

There's also `charging`, `gyro`, `slider_3d`, `slider_volume`, `model`,
`firmware`, `region`, `language`, `steps`, `wifi`, `shell`, `adapter` and
`battery_voltage`. The sensors show up on `/dev/input/event0` as evdev axes
too.

`mic.pcm` never hits EOF, so read it with `dd count=…` instead of `cat`.
Grabbing a camera frame freezes the guest for up to a second.

## Networking

If the 3DS is on WiFi, the guest gets a DHCP lease on `10.0.2.0/24` and
outbound TCP/UDP/DNS goes out through the console. Homebrew can't open raw
sockets, so `ping` only answers from the gateway (`10.0.2.2`), and nothing can
connect in.

## Notes

Guest RAM is whatever the app can get from the 3DS heap: about 54MB on a New
3DS, about 20MB on an Old 3DS. There's another 64MB of swap on
`sdmc:/swap.img`. An Old 3DS has no spare CPU core so it's slower, and the app
drops the UI to ~8fps to leave more for Linux. The first line of the boot log
tells you which model it detected.

If you get `Image too large for RAM`, your `Image` and `3ds-cli.3dsx` are from
different releases. Update both.

## Building

The emulator core and the touch keyboard are submodules, so clone with them:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cmdada/3DS-CLI
```

The five Nintendo consoles each need their own devkitPro toolchain, and all
of them need zlib:

```sh
dkp-pacman -S 3ds-dev wiiu-dev switch-dev wii-dev gamecube-dev
dkp-pacman -S 3ds-zlib ppc-zlib switch-zlib
```

The PSP is not a devkitPro target: i used [pspdev](https://github.com/pspdev/pspdev), Its `bin/` has to be on
`PATH` so `psp-config` is found.

For vita install vdpm and then

```sh
vdpm install curl-mbedtls zlib
```

`mk/vita.mk` looks in `/usr/local/vitasdk` unless `VITASDK` says otherwise.

```sh
make            # 3ds-cli.3dsx
make cia        # also 3ds-cli.cia (needs bannertool + makerom)
make wiiu       # dist/wiiu/3ds-cli.rpx and .wuhb
make switch     # dist/switch/3ds-cli.nro
make wii        # dist/wii/3ds-cli.dol
make gamecube   # dist/cube/3ds-cli.dol
make psp        # dist/psp/EBOOT.PBP
make vita       # dist/vita/3ds-cli.vpk
make dtb        # regenerate the device tree after editing source/3ds-cli.dts
```

Only the 3DS builds to the repo root; every other console writes to `dist/`,
because the binaries all keep the `3ds-cli` name and two of them are a `.dol`.

`source/core/` is the whole machine: the emulator, the virtio devices, the
terminal and the settings page. It includes no console SDK header at all.
Each console supplies `plat.c`, `plat_cfg.h`, `plat_hw.h` and `plat_kbd.h`
under `source/platform/<console>/`, against the interface in
`source/core/plat.h`. Adding a console means writing those four files.

The kernel and rootfs are built with the Buildroot tree in `buildroot/`:

```sh
wget https://buildroot.org/downloads/buildroot-2024.02.9.tar.gz
tar xf buildroot-2024.02.9.tar.gz && cd buildroot-2024.02.9
make BR2_EXTERNAL=../buildroot O=../out 3ds_defconfig
make O=../out
cd .. && python3 tools/mkimage.py out/images/Image out/images/rootfs.ext4 Image
```

Nothing under `buildroot/` is console-specific: the same kernel and rootfs
boot on all seven, and the guest learns its terminal size from
`/mnt/3ds/hw/console_size`. Kernel config is
`buildroot/board/3ds-cli/linux.config`. Packages are in
`buildroot/configs/3ds_defconfig`. You can also just put a plain kernel `Image`
and a separate `rootfs.ext2` on the SD card, which is easier while iterating.
